## Finding Content

Content is organized in `site/pages/` with a predictable structure:

- **Pages** are folders: `pages/about/`, `pages/pricing/`
- **Sections** are numbered markdown files: `1-hero.md`, `2-features.md`
- **page.yml** in each folder defines page metadata

Use your editor's search (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F) to find content across all pages.
