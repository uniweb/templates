### Adding a New Page

1. Create a folder: `site/pages/my-page/`
2. Add `page.yml`:
   ```yaml
   title: My Page
   ```
3. Add section files: `1-hero.md`, `2-content.md`, etc.

### Section Ordering

By default, sections are discovered from `.md` files and sorted by numeric prefix (`1-`, `2-`, `3-`).

**Decimal prefixes** allow inserting sections without renumbering: `2.5-` sorts between `2-` and `3-`.

For explicit control, use the `sections` property in `page.yml`:

```yaml
title: My Page
sections:
  - hero
  - features
  - pricing
```

This makes reordering easy (move lines) and allows commenting out sections temporarily.

**Options:**
- `sections: *` or omit — auto-discover and sort `.md` files by prefix (default)
- `sections: [hero, features]` — explicit ordering, no prefixes needed
- `sections: []` — pure route with no content sections

### Section Hierarchy (Subsections)

For parent-child relationships, use the explicit array with nesting:

```yaml
sections:
  - hero
  - features:
      - logocloud
      - stats
  - pricing
```

This is clearer than prefix notation and easier to restructure.

**Advanced:** Comma prefixes (`1,1-`, `1,2-`) also denote hierarchy, but explicit arrays are recommended for readability.

### Page Ordering and Index Pages

Parent controls which page is the "index" for its route. The index page gets the parent's route.

**In `site.yml`** (for top-level pages):
```yaml
name: My Site
pages: [home, about, features]  # First (home) is homepage at /
# Or just name the homepage:
index: home
```

**In `page.yml`** (for child pages):
```yaml
title: Documentation
pages: [getting-started, installation, config]  # First is index for /docs
# Or just name the index:
index: getting-started
```

**How it works:**
- `pages: [a, b, c]` — Explicit order, first item gets parent route
- `index: name` — Just set the index, auto-discover the rest
- Omit both — Sort by `order` prop, lowest becomes index

**Example:** If `getting-started` is the index for `/docs`:
- `pages/docs/getting-started/` → route `/docs`
- `pages/docs/installation/` → route `/docs/installation`
