### Getting Started

# Configuration (v1)

## Legacy configuration options

This covers the v1 configuration format. For the current configuration options, see the [latest documentation](page:configuration).

### Config file

In v1, configuration was stored in a JSON file at the project root.

### Legacy options

- outputDir: Build output directory
- theme: Basic theme settings
- plugins: Plugin configuration

### Migration

V2 uses a YAML-based configuration with expanded options and better defaults.
