# {{projectName}}

A Uniweb project demonstrating **extensions** — secondary foundations that contribute additional section types to a site.

## Structure

- **`foundation/`** — Primary foundation with general-purpose section types (Header, Hero, Features, Footer)
- **`effects/`** — Extension foundation with visual effects (ParticleHero, AnimatedCounter)
- **`site/`** — Site that uses section types from both foundations

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dev script builds the effects extension first, then starts the site dev server. Both primary and extension section types are available.

## How Extensions Work

The site declares extensions in `site.yml`:

```yaml
extensions:
  - /effects/foundation.js
```

The runtime loads the primary foundation (bundled into the site), then loads each extension via `import()`. Section types from all sources are available to content authors — they write `type: ParticleHero` in frontmatter and the runtime resolves it from whichever foundation provides it.

**Resolution order:** Primary foundation wins. If both define a component with the same name, the primary's version is used. Extensions are checked in the order they're declared.

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

This builds the primary foundation, then the effects extension, then the site, and copies the extension output into `site/dist/effects/` so it's served from the same domain.
