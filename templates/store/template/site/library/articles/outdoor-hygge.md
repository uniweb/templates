Hygge isn't just for the winter months, and it certainly isn't restricted to the indoors. As the boundaries between our living rooms and our gardens continue to blur, the concept of outdoor hygge has become a cornerstone of modern architectural philosophy.

The key to achieving this "garden sanctuary" state lies in the careful orchestration of three elements: warmth, texture, and — most importantly — intentional lighting.

When we design lighting for the outdoors, we often fall into the trap of "over-illumination." We want to see everything. But hygge is born in the shadows. It's the soft glow of a low-sitting lantern tucked under a fern, or the way amber light catches the ripples in a stone water feature.

At Solis Artisans, we've spent years perfecting the 2700K color temperature. It's the exact golden hue of a waning sun. By using solar-powered lanterns like the Meridian, you can place these pockets of warmth in areas where wiring would be impossible, allowing the light to feel organic to the landscape rather than an intrusion upon it.
