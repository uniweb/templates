Let's explore patterns that work well.\n\n## The Single Responsibility Principle\n\nEach component should do one thing well. This makes components easier to understand, test, and reuse.\n\n## Using Content Structure\n\nUniweb provides a guaranteed content structure. Take advantage of this to write cleaner component code without defensive null checks."

Components opt into inherited data using `inheritData` in their meta.js."
