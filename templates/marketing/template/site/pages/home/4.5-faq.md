## Frequently Asked Questions

Have questions? We've got answers.

### What is Uniweb?

Uniweb is a component web platform that separates content from code. You write your content in simple markdown files, and the platform renders it using customizable React components. It's perfect for marketing sites, documentation, and blogs.

### Do I need to know how to code?

No! Content authors only need to know markdown, which is a simple text format. If you can write an email, you can write content for Uniweb. Developers can customize components, but it's not required to get started.

### How does pricing work?

We offer flexible pricing based on your needs. Start free with our open source foundation, or upgrade to premium features like analytics, custom domains, and priority support. See our pricing section for details.

### Can I use my own design?

Absolutely! You can customize the existing foundation components or create your own from scratch. The component system is designed to be extended and modified to match your brand.

### What hosting options are available?

Uniweb sites are static, so they can be deployed anywhere. We recommend Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages for free hosting. Enterprise customers can use their own infrastructure.

### Is there a learning curve?

The learning curve is minimal. Most users are productive within an hour. We provide comprehensive documentation, video tutorials, and a supportive community to help you succeed.
