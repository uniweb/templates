# Protecting Panda Habitats in Sichuan

Our latest initiative in Sichuan province has successfully established three new wildlife corridors connecting previously isolated bamboo forests. These corridors are critical for allowing pandas to move between territories, find mates, and access diverse bamboo species.

## The Challenge

Giant pandas require large areas of bamboo forest to survive. However, decades of development have fragmented their habitat into isolated patches. When bamboo in one area dies after flowering (which happens every 15-120 years depending on the species), pandas in isolated patches cannot migrate to find food.

## Our Approach

Working with local communities and government agencies, we identified key corridor routes using:

- Satellite imagery analysis
- GPS tracking data from collared pandas
- Ground surveys of bamboo distribution
- Community interviews about historical panda sightings

## Results

The three new corridors span a combined 45 kilometers, connecting five previously isolated forest patches. Camera trap monitoring has already documented pandas using all three corridors.

## What's Next

We are now working to establish formal protected status for these corridors and developing sustainable forestry practices with local communities to ensure long-term habitat protection.
