# Our Mission

## Protecting Pandas in Their Natural Habitat

PandaWatch was founded in 2008 by a team of wildlife biologists and conservationists dedicated to ensuring the survival of giant pandas in the wild. Based in Chengdu, China, with research stations across Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, we work at the heart of panda country.

Our approach combines rigorous scientific research with community-based conservation. We believe that lasting protection for pandas requires understanding their ecology, restoring their habitats, and creating sustainable partnerships with the local communities who share their mountain homes.
