# Components

## Understanding the component system

Components are the building blocks of your documentation site. Each component handles a specific type of content and can be customized through parameters.

### Available components

The documentation template includes several components:

- DocSection: Main documentation content
- CodeBlock: Syntax-highlighted code examples
- Header: Site navigation header
- LeftPanel: Sidebar navigation
- Footer: Site footer

### Customizing components

Each component can be customized through parameters in the frontmatter. Refer to each component's documentation for available options.

### Creating custom components

Advanced users can create custom components by extending the foundation. This allows you to add specialized content types for your documentation.
