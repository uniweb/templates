## Research Areas

### Natural Language Processing

We develop models that understand and generate human language with unprecedented accuracy. Our work focuses on contextual understanding, multilingual capabilities, and handling complex discourse structures. Recent projects include large language model interpretability and cross-lingual transfer learning.

### Machine Learning for Healthcare

Applying AI techniques to improve medical diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. We work closely with clinicians at Stanford Hospital to develop systems that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows while maintaining high accuracy and reliability.

### AI Ethics and Fairness

Our research investigates bias in AI systems and develops methods to ensure fair and equitable outcomes across different demographic groups. We create evaluation frameworks, debiasing techniques, and guidelines for responsible AI deployment.

### Human-AI Collaboration

Designing systems where humans and AI work together effectively. We study how to best leverage the complementary strengths of human expertise and machine capabilities, particularly in high-stakes decision-making contexts.
