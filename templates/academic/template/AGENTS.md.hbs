## Academic Template Features

This template includes specialized components and integrations for academic websites.

### @uniweb/scholar Integration

The foundation includes `@uniweb/scholar` for professional academic content:

```javascript
// Available imports in components
import { formatReference, CiteButton, DoiLink, AuthorList } from '@uniweb/scholar'
import { Math, Equation, EquationProvider } from '@uniweb/scholar/math'
import { CitationProvider, Citation, Bibliography } from '@uniweb/scholar/citations'
```

### Academic Components

#### PublicationList

Display publications with professional citation formatting.

```markdown
---

```

**Content structure per publication:**
- H4 (####) before H3: Publication type (journal, conference, book, preprint)
- H3 (###): Paper title
- Paragraph 1: Authors
- Paragraph 2: Venue/Journal

### Mathematical Foundations

# Section Title

Text with inline math like $E = mc^2$ and display math:

$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

### Equation Name

\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)

Description of the equation.
```

**Math syntax:**
- Inline: `$...$` within paragraphs
- Display: `$$...$$` for block equations
- Named equations: H3 heading + LaTeX in first paragraph

#### ProfileHero

```

### Publication Type Colors

The template defines semantic colors for publication types in `foundation/src/styles.css`:

```css
@theme {
  --color-journal: #3b82f6;     /* Blue */
  --color-conference: #8b5cf6;  /* Purple */
  --color-book: #22c55e;        /* Green */
  --color-preprint: #f59e0b;    /* Amber */
}
```

Use in components: `bg-journal`, `bg-conference`, `bg-book`, `bg-preprint`

### Adding Publications

1. Publications live in `site/pages/publications/` or inline on other pages
2. Each H3 section is one publication
3. Use H4 before H3 to set publication type
4. DOI is the 4th paragraph (just the identifier, not full URL)
5. The CiteButton lets visitors copy citations in any format

### Adding Math Content

1. Use the `MathBlock` component for equation-heavy sections
2. Inline math works in any paragraph with `$...$`
3. Named equations use H3 headings followed by LaTeX
4. Equations are numbered automatically within an `EquationProvider`

### Search

Search is enabled by default and indexes all content including:
- Page titles and headings
- Publication titles and authors
- Research area descriptions

Configure in `site/site.yml`:

```yaml
search:
  enabled: true
```
