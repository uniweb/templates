# Active Research Areas

Our team of scientists works across multiple disciplines to understand and protect giant pandas.

### Population Monitoring

Using camera traps, GPS collars, and genetic sampling to track panda populations across their range. Our data informs protected area management decisions.

### Habitat Analysis

Mapping bamboo distribution, forest connectivity, and climate impacts to identify critical conservation priorities and restoration opportunities.

### Behavioral Ecology

Studying panda feeding patterns, territorial behavior, and reproduction to understand their ecological needs and support breeding programs.

### Climate Adaptation

Researching how climate change affects bamboo forests and panda habitats to develop long-term conservation strategies.
